Devops is a software development methodology which improves the collaboration between developers and operations team using various automation tool.
The process includes :
Dev -
1. Continuous Development: Plan, Code
2. Continuous Testing: Build, Test

Ops -
1. Continuous Deployment: Release, Deploy
2. Continuous Monitoring: Operate, Monitor

and Continuous integration sits between Dev and Ops.




Firmware literally means a software running inside an application specific chip
(like microcontroller). So development of such software is firmware development.

The chips I have used are microcontroller 8051, icatch V35, icatch V50, Ambrella Amba chip
The language I have used for firmware development are C, C++



Data engineering is to develop the architecture that helps analyze and process data
in the way the organization needs it, and make sure those systems are performing smoothly.

I have used:
Big data tool : ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash)
Messaging system : Apache Kafka


Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information
from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user.

The tool i used for web scraping are : Selenium, BeautifulSoup


Full stack development refers to the development of both front end and back end portions of an application.
This web development process involves all three layer- Presentation layer(front end part that deals with the user interface),
Business Logic Layer(back end part that deals with data validation) and the database Layer.

The tools involved are :
Frontend languages - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery
Frontend Framework - VueJs
Backend languages - Python, Scala
Backend Framework - Django, Flask
DataBase - Mongo, Arango, Postgres
Webserver - Nginx
WSGI server - Gunicorn
Web Hosting - AWS
